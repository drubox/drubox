Drubox
======

Drubox is not a distribution anymore. Drubox is toolbox for profiles in Drupal which can be use for add new roles, create menus, create wysiwyg profiles and (I hope) much more in the future

##Usage
To use that utilities you have to do: 
* Copy the Drubox directory in your profile directory
* Write an include_once ("utils/Drubox.php") in your module.profile file

##Demo
In this repository cames a file called "demo.profile" with the use of this utilities.

##Some Info
I just delete the olders revisions to trying reduce the size of the git repository. Hope it works...
